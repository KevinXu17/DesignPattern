2) structural patterns
compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities
adapter; bridge; filter, criteria; composite; decorator; facade; flyweight; proxy
3) behavioral patterns
communication between objects
chain of responsibility; command; interpreter; iterator; mediator; memento; observer; state; Null object; strategy; template; visitor
4) J2EE pattern
MVC; business delegate; composite entity; DAO; front controller; intercepting filter; service locator; transfer object
